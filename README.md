# Fract-ol

### Threads
While making fractals the iterations it has the slower it gets. 
In this project I learned the basics of using threads and how much it can affect the results.
By increasing the iterations in Header file the deeper you can dive by zooming until the the pixels starts to look bad.

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Runs on MAC

Run it with `./fractol [fractal name]`. Possible fractals are: `Mandelbrot`, `Julia`,
`Burningship`, and `Tricorn`. On the left You have a HUB with instructions. 
How to zoom, how to change colors and etc.
