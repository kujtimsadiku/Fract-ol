# Fract-ol

### Threads
While making fractals the more iterations it has the slower it gets. 
In this project I learned the basics of using threads and how much it can affect the results.
The iteration must be increased in Header file to dive deeper into the art.

When you run the executable it starts without using threads. By pressing 'T' you can turn the threads on.

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Runs on MAC

Run it with `./fractol [fractal name]`. Possible fractals are: `Mandelbrot`, `Julia`,
`Burningship`, and `Tricorn`. On the left You have a HUB with instructions. 
How to zoom, how to change colors and etc.
